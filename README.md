===============

The best way to bypass iCloud Activation Lock on your iOS 7 device. Made possible with the generosity of Gadgetwide.com. Happy April 1st.

First Plugin your device...

To run this, just open up Terminal and enter in /Users/(username)/Downloads/d0gecl0udbyp4ss-master/pwn.sh

If you saved it elsewhere, just change /Downloads/ to wherever. So if you saved the folder to Desktop, then enter in /Desktop/ instead of /Downloads/

This runs on Mac OS X and Linux ONLY! I made it in bash script to porting over to Windows might take a while, but I'll get around to doing it soon I guess. Or if you are using Windows, you can try using Cygwin to run the script. 


Thanks for your support!
